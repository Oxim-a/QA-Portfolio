# QA-Portfolio
Hello to everyone! I'm Aksana, junior QA specialist.

I can't say that testing is something fundamentally new in my life. For many years I've been working with web content, websites, and I've crossed paths with testing in one way or another. I just decided that it was time to go deeper into this area.

That's why I:
✅️ Completed software testing courses at the IT Academy.
✅️ I am doing an internship in ITBootcamp

And now I am:
✅️ Junior software test specialist and looking for a job.
